# ‚ö°Ô∏èü§ò‚ö°Ô∏è Yet-Another-Trigger-Framework ‚ö°Ô∏èü§ò‚ö°Ô∏è

_This "framework" is an extension of the [`TriggerHandler` pattern which original shipped with Mavensmate](https://github.com/joeferraro/MavensMate-Templates/blob/master/ApexClass/TriggerHandler.cls)_

# üí™Goals

The goal of this project is to improve upon that class, by adding additional configuration and capabilities, while at the same time **retaining full backwards compatibility**.

## ‚ú®Features

-   Dynamic Binding of Trigger Handlers via Custom Metadata (similar to table based trigger)
-   Ability to disable whole triggers or individual handlers
-   Easy to upgrade, full backwards compatibility
-   Ability to decouple your handlers from the system static `Trigger`context, which allows for better unit testability (no need to actually run DML in tests)

### Coming Soon

-   Dynamic error handling strategies
-   logging/notifications
-   built in recursion control
-   support for other popular framework patterns ((sfdc-trigger-framework)[https://github.com/kevinohara80/sfdc-trigger-framework])

## üì¶Installation

-   [Package URL](https://login.salesforce.com/packaging/installPackage.apexp?p0=04t1C000000xAewQAE]) (replace host as needed)

-   command line: `sfdx force:package:install -p 04t1C000000xAewQAE -u {TARGET ALIAS OR USERNAME} -b 1000 -w 1000`

## üî®Usage

At it's most basic, the concept is very simple:

1. Create a class that `implements YATF.Handler`
1. Write a `void handle(){}` method to perform the trigger logic
1. Create a trigger (one trigger per object!) and bind your handlers to the appropriate events.

#### Example:

```java
public class AccountGreeter implements YATF.Handler{
  public void handler(){
    for(Account acc : (Account[]) Trigger.new){
      System.debug('Hello ' + acc.Name);
    }
  }
}
```

#### Decoupled Handler

The design is not finalized, but the basic idea is to pass in or inject a proxy to the static `Trigger` variable (see [`TriggerContext`](https://github.com/callawaycloud/yet-another-trigger-framework/blob/master/src/main/default/classes/TriggerContext.cls)). This will allow you to define your own context during unit tests.

### Binding

#### Static Binding

```java
trigger AccountTrigger on Account(before insert){
  YATF.Manager m = new YATF.Manager();
  AccountGreeter greeter = new HelloHandler();
  m.bind(System.TriggerOperation.BEFORE_INSERT, greeter);
  m.manage();
}
```

#### Dynamic Binding

In order to take advantage of configuration based features (disabling handlers, etc), we must dynamically bind our handlers to the trigger Manager.

To do this for the above example:

1. update the `.trigger` to fire on all event:

```java
trigger AccountMaster on Account(
    after insert,
    after update,
    after delete,
    after undelete,
    before insert,
    before update,
    before delete
) {
  new YATF.Manager().manage();
}
```

_WARNING: this is technically not required. The performance impact of binding to all events is untested. If you are concerned, only bind the events you are using!_

2. Setup the Custom Metadata

-   navigate to `setup -> Custom Metadata -> Trigger Object -> manage`
-   create a new Record.
    -   Set the `Object API Name` field to "Account"
    -   Save
-   create a new child `Trigger Handler`
    -   Set the `Handler Class` to "AccountGreeter"
    -   Check the `Before Update` box

_NOTES_:

-   Dynamic Binding and Static binding can co-exist! Statically will execute first.
-   You can create a dynamic configuration for a statically bound trigger. The handler will **only execute one time per event**, but this allows you to disable a handler without having to deploy code.

## Upgrading from Mavensmate "TriggerHandler"

1. Replace all instances of `TriggerHandler.HandlerInterface` with `YATF.Handler`

1. Replace all instances of `TriggerHandler` class with `YATF.Manager`.

1. Delete the `TriggerHandler` class from org

That's it! There should be no functional changes, but it's a good idea to run all unit tests before and after to confirm.
